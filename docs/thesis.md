## Introduction
In the modern data-driven world, enhanced tools for analyzing complex datasets are crucial, particularly in healthcare. This thesis examines how Large Language Models (LLMs), which incorporate advanced natural language processing capabilities, can improve tabular data analysis, potentially outperforming traditional methods and enhancing patient outcomes.

---

## Literature Review
Recent advancements, such as TabLLM and UniPredict, have integrated LLMs with tabular data, showing promising results across various domains, including healthcare. Traditional models like logistic regression and SVMs, while effective, often fall short in capturing complex patterns in data, a gap that LLMs aim to fill.

---

## Methodology
### Comparative Performance of LLMs vs. Traditional Models
A comprehensive evaluation is conducted across heart disease and breast cancer datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare LLMs with traditional models.

### Leveraging LLMs for Enhanced Tabular Data Analysis
This section explores innovative methods of integrating LLMs into the machine learning pipeline, focusing on feature extraction, model initialization, and ensemble techniques.

---

## Datasets
### Heart Disease Dataset
The dataset features clinical attributes that are crucial for early diagnosis of heart disease, used to test the effectiveness of predictive models.

### Breast Cancer Dataset
Detailed measurements from digitized images are analyzed to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors, showcasing the precision of advanced modeling techniques.

---

## Results
The results indicate that LLMs often outperform traditional models in accuracy and efficiency, particularly in complex scenarios involving unstructured data.

---

## Discussion
The analysis confirms the superiority of LLMs in handling tabular data, especially in cases where traditional models fail to capture the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

---

## Conclusions
LLMs have demonstrated potential to significantly enhance tabular data analysis, particularly in healthcare settings, suggesting a shift towards more sophisticated analytical tools in critical sectors.
