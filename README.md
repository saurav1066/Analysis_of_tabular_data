Steps to Incorporate Sampling Concepts

Identify the Sampling Technique: Choose the appropriate sampling technique for the dataset. Common techniques include:

Random Under-Sampling: Reducing the number of majority class samples to match the minority class.
Random Over-Sampling: Increasing the number of minority class samples to match the majority class.
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Generating synthetic samples for the minority class.

Apply Sampling During Data Preparation: Integrate the chosen sampling technique into the data preprocessing pipeline.

Train the LLM with Sampled Data: Train the BERT model using the resampled dataset.

Evaluate and Compare: Evaluate the model performance and compare it with the model trained on the original dataset to study the effects of sampling.

Incorporate stratified sampling as well. wizh male and female
